# AWS Ontology

This project develops an OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology for AWS (Amazon Web Services) objects and their relationships. The ontology aims to provide a formal, machine-readable representation of AWS services, resources, and their interconnections.

## Project Overview

The AWS Ontology project creates a comprehensive semantic model of AWS infrastructure and services. This ontology can be used for:
- Knowledge representation of AWS resources and relationships
- Automated reasoning about AWS architectures
- Semantic querying of AWS configurations
- Documentation and learning resources
