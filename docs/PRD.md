# AWS Object and Relationship Ontology Development - Product Requirements Document

**Document Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** December 2024

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system tasked with developing a formal ontology for Amazon Web Services (AWS) objects and their interrelationships. The goal is to create a machine-readable model that ensures consistent data representation, facilitates advanced querying, and enables comprehensive analysis of AWS configurations.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective is to define a comprehensive and semantically rich ontology of AWS resources and their operational, structural, and logical connections. This ontology will serve as a foundational knowledge base for understanding complex AWS environments.

## 3. Scope

The ontology should primarily focus on core and widely used AWS services. Initial focus areas include:

### Core Services
- **Compute:** EC2 (Instances, AMIs, Security Groups, Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups), Lambda
- **Storage:** S3 (Buckets, Objects), EBS (Volumes, Snapshots), RDS (Instances, Databases)
- **Networking:** VPC (Subnets, Route Tables, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways), Security Groups, Network ACLs
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Users, Roles, Policies, Groups
- **Databases:** DynamoDB, Aurora (as part of RDS)
- **Monitoring & Logging:** CloudWatch, CloudTrail

The ontology prioritizes relationships that are fundamental to how these services interact and are managed.

## 4. Key Entities (Classes)

Required classes for AWS objects include:

### Infrastructure Classes
- AWSAccount
- AWSRegion
- AvailabilityZone

### Compute Classes
- EC2Instance
- EC2AMI
- EC2SecurityGroup
- EC2LoadBalancer

### Storage Classes
- S3Bucket
- S3Object
- EBSVolume
- EBSSnapshot
- RDSInstance
- RDSDatabase

### Identity Classes
- IAMUser
- IAMRole
- IAMPolicy
- IAMGroup

### Networking Classes
- VPC
- Subnet
- RouteTable
- InternetGateway
- NATGateway

### Monitoring Classes
- CloudWatchMetric
- CloudWatchAlarm
- CloudTrailLog
- LambdaFunction

Additional classes may be inferred as necessary to represent the AWS ecosystem accurately.

## 5. Relationships (Properties)

### Structural/Compositional
- hasRegion (AWSAccount -> AWSRegion)
- hasAvailabilityZone (AWSRegion -> AvailabilityZone)
- contains (VPC -> Subnet, S3Bucket -> S3Object)
- attachedTo (EBSVolume -> EC2Instance)
- belongsToVPC (EC2Instance -> VPC, Subnet -> VPC)

### Access/Permission
- canAssumeRole (IAMUser/IAMRole -> IAMRole)
- hasPolicy (IAMUser/IAMRole/IAMGroup -> IAMPolicy)
- appliesTo (EC2SecurityGroup -> EC2Instance)

### Operational/Functional
- uses (EC2Instance -> EC2AMI, LambdaFunction -> S3Bucket)
- manages (RDSInstance -> RDSDatabase)
- monitors (CloudWatchAlarm -> CloudWatchMetric)
- logsActivityOf (CloudTrailLog -> AWSAccount)
- routesTrafficThrough (RouteTable -> InternetGateway/NATGateway)

### Dependency
- dependsOn (general dependency, to be refined)
- isSourceFor (e.g., Snapshot is source for Volume)

Inverse properties should be defined where semantically meaningful. Data properties should be identified for key attributes.

## 6. Output Format

The final output must be a comprehensive OWL (Web Ontology Language) file that:

- Adheres strictly to OWL 2 DL specifications
- Defines all identified classes using owl:Class
- Defines all relationships using owl:ObjectProperty and owl:DatatypeProperty
- Specifies domain and range for all properties
- Includes inverse properties where applicable
- Utilizes appropriate OWL axioms
- Is well-structured, readable, and includes comments
- Is machine-readable and parsable by standard OWL reasoners and tools

## 7. Data Sources

The ontology should be based on:

- AWS Service Documentation
- AWS Whitepapers
- AWS API Reference documentation

## 8. Quality Criteria

The ontology will be evaluated based on:

- **Consistency:** Logically consistent and free from contradictions
- **Completeness:** Comprehensive coverage of specified scope
- **Accuracy:** Accurate reflection of AWS services behavior and structure
- **Expressiveness:** Effective use of OWL constructs
- **Usability:** Facilitates querying, reasoning, and integration
- **Modularity:** (Optional) Structured for easy extension and maintenance

## 9. Success Metrics

The project success will be measured using the following quantitative and qualitative metrics:

### Coverage Metrics
- **Service Coverage:** >90% of specified AWS services represented in ontology
- **Relationship Coverage:** >80% of critical service relationships modeled
- **IAM Coverage:** 100% coverage of core IAM concepts (Users, Roles, Policies, Groups)

### Performance Metrics
- **Ontology Loading:** <5 seconds for complete ontology loading in standard tools
- **Query Response Time:** <1 second for common SPARQL/AQL query patterns
- **Transformation Time:** <30 seconds for ArangoDB transformation of complete ontology
- **Memory Usage:** <500MB RAM for ontology reasoning operations

### Quality Metrics
- **OWL Compliance:** 100% OWL 2 DL specification compliance
- **Validation Success:** 100% successful validation with standard OWL reasoners
- **Example Coverage:** >50 real-world example instances across all major service categories
- **Documentation Coverage:** 100% of classes and properties documented with labels and comments

### Integration Metrics
- **Format Support:** Support for minimum 2 RDF serialization formats (OWL/XML, Turtle)
- **Tool Compatibility:** Compatible with minimum 3 major ontology tools (Protégé, Apache Jena, etc.)
- **Database Integration:** Successful transformation to minimum 1 graph database format (ArangoDB)

## 10. Maintenance and Versioning Strategy

### Version Control
- **Semantic Versioning:** Use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme
  - MAJOR: Breaking changes to ontology structure
  - MINOR: New AWS services or non-breaking additions
  - PATCH: Bug fixes, documentation updates, example additions

### Update Schedule
- **Quarterly Reviews:** Regular assessment of new AWS services and features
- **Annual Major Updates:** Comprehensive review and potential restructuring
- **On-Demand Updates:** Critical security-related updates as needed

### Backward Compatibility
- **API Stability:** Maintain backward compatibility for existing relationships and classes
- **Deprecation Policy:** 6-month notice period for deprecated concepts
- **Migration Support:** Provide transformation scripts for major version updates

### Change Management
- **Change Documentation:** All modifications documented with rationale and impact assessment
- **Testing Requirements:** All changes validated against test suites and example instances
- **Stakeholder Review:** Major changes reviewed by project stakeholders before implementation

### Maintenance Responsibilities
- **Technical Maintenance:** Regular updates to reflect AWS service changes
- **Documentation Maintenance:** Keep all documentation current with implementation
- **Example Maintenance:** Ensure examples remain valid and representative
- **Tool Compatibility:** Verify compatibility with updated versions of dependent tools

## 11. Security and Privacy Considerations

### Information Security
- **Public Information Only:** Ontology based exclusively on publicly available AWS documentation
- **No Proprietary Data:** No inclusion of internal AWS architecture or proprietary information
- **Sanitized Examples:** All example instances use fictional or anonymized data
- **Private Development:** Development conducted in private repository to protect work-in-progress

### Data Privacy
- **No Personal Data:** Examples contain no personally identifiable information (PII)
- **Generic Resource Names:** Use generic naming patterns in examples
- **Anonymized Configurations:** Real-world configurations anonymized before inclusion

### Access Control
- **Repository Security:** Private repository with controlled access
- **Contributor Validation:** All contributors verified before repository access
- **Secure Communication:** All project communications through secure channels

### Compliance Considerations
- **License Compliance:** Ensure all dependencies and tools comply with project licensing
- **Export Control:** Verify no export control restrictions on ontology or tools
- **Attribution Requirements:** Proper attribution for any derived or referenced work

### Risk Mitigation
- **Regular Security Reviews:** Periodic review of security practices and repository access
- **Backup Strategy:** Regular backups of ontology and development artifacts
- **Version Recovery:** Ability to recover previous versions if security issues identified
- **Incident Response:** Defined process for handling potential security incidents

## 12. Constraints and Assumptions
