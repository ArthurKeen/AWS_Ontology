# AWS Ontology - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

The AWS Ontology project aims to create a comprehensive OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology that represents AWS services, resources, and their relationships. This ontology will serve as a formal knowledge representation system for AWS infrastructure.

## Goals

1. Create a machine-readable representation of AWS resources and their relationships
2. Enable semantic reasoning about AWS architectures
3. Facilitate automated validation of AWS configurations
4. Support knowledge discovery and learning about AWS services

## Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Ontology Development**
   - Develop an OWL ontology covering major AWS services and resources
   - Define clear class hierarchies for AWS resource types
   - Model relationships between different AWS services
   - Include properties that describe service capabilities and constraints

2. **Service Coverage**
   - Initial focus on core AWS services:
     - Compute (EC2, Lambda, ECS)
     - Storage (S3, EBS, EFS)
     - Networking (VPC, Route53, CloudFront)
     - Database (RDS, DynamoDB)
     - Security (IAM, KMS)
   - Plan for extensibility to cover additional services

3. **Relationship Modeling**
   - Define service dependencies
   - Model security relationships
   - Represent networking connections
   - Capture resource ownership and containment

### Technical Requirements

1. **Ontology Format**
   - Use OWL 2 as the ontology language
   - Ensure compatibility with popular ontology editors (Protégé)
   - Maintain machine-readable and human-readable formats

2. **Validation**
   - Include axioms for constraint checking
   - Support SPARQL queries for knowledge extraction
   - Enable reasoning for architecture validation

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive documentation of classes and properties
   - Usage examples and patterns
   - Integration guidelines

### Quality Requirements

1. **Accuracy**
   - Accurate representation of AWS service capabilities
   - Up-to-date with AWS service offerings
   - Validated against AWS documentation

2. **Maintainability**
   - Modular design for easy updates
   - Version control and change tracking
   - Clear contribution guidelines

3. **Usability**
   - Intuitive class and property naming
   - Well-documented examples
   - Easy integration with tools

## Success Metrics

1. Coverage of AWS services (percentage of major services represented)
2. Number of validated use cases
3. Community adoption and contribution
4. Integration with AWS tools and workflows

## Timeline

### Phase 1 (Initial Development)
- Set up project infrastructure
- Define core classes and relationships
- Model initial set of AWS services

### Phase 2 (Expansion)
- Add more AWS services
- Develop validation tools
- Create documentation and examples

### Phase 3 (Community and Tools)
- Release to the community
- Develop supporting tools
- Gather feedback and iterate

## Future Considerations

1. Integration with AWS CloudFormation
2. Support for automated architecture validation
3. Development of visualization tools
4. Integration with AWS compliance frameworks
